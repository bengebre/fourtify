# Fourtify
Fourtify finds additional sources along a specified orbit in a transient source dataset in order to extend linkages to 4+ nights.

## Installation
While Fourtify is a generalized implementation for any observer at any location, this initial release was designed to work "out of the box" with the Vera C. Rubin observatory's DP0.3 simulation data on the Rubin Science Platform (RSP). As such, the example code in this repository currently requires access to the RSP to run. With that said, the code should be explanatory for those looking to use Fourtify with observations from other observatories.

<br />

Fourtify can be installed like so:
```console
pip install git+https://github.com/bengebre/fourtify
```

## Usage

Fourtify is initialized in the examlpe below via `Fourtify()` with the observational data you will be searching: `obs_radecs`: *observations RA and DEC*, `obs_times`: *observation times*, and `obs_locs`: *observer heliocentric locations*.  You only have to initialize the observational data once.  

Next, the `orbit()` method is used to search along the specified orbit defined by `elems`: *(a,e,i,peri,node,M)* at the `epoch` *time* for observations that are within (in the example below) *10"*  at most and deviating at a rate no more than *1" per day* from this orbit (a cone that spreads out 1"/day until it reaches 10" and is fixed at 10" thereafter).  

The `orbit()` method returns `dradecs`: *the residuals of the sources found in the observation set that meet these criteria* and `fidx`: *the indices of those sources*.

<br />

```python
ff = Fourtify(obs_radecs,obs_times,obs_locs)    #observer RA/DEC (degrees), observation times (TDB jdate), observer locations (heliocentric AU)
dradecs,fidx = ff.orbit(elems,epoch,(10,1))     #(a,e,i,peri,node,M) (degrees), orbit epoch (TDB jdate), (deviation, deviation rate) (arcsec, arcsec/day)
```

<br />

For a more complete example, the rendered notebook ```FourtifyExamples.ipynb``` in the [examples/](https://github.com/bengebre/fourtify/blob/main/examples/) directory extends a 3 night candidate link found with HelioLinC in DP0.3 data to 8 nights.
